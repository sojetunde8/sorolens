-- 000015_contract_notes
--
-- Markdown notes attached to a tracked contract (issue #164).
-- A note is the institutional knowledge that does not belong in
-- any single indexed row: why a contract was migrated, who owns
-- it, what changed at which point in time.
--
-- id          generated here so both the API and the indexer can
--             insert without coordinating an ID scheme
-- author      the identity that wrote the note, as passed in
--             X-User-ID; only that identity may later edit or
--             delete the row
-- body        markdown source; rendering is the client's job
-- created_at  set on insert, never rewritten
-- updated_at  bumped by edits, so the detail page can show that
--             a note was revised after it was written
